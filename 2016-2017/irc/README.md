# Minimal IRC-client for 'Computer networks' exam
Can connect to the IRC-server and join rooms without password.

When someone sends message 'show some magic' mentioning the client's name, it sends a random joke from site http://baneks.ru/

##How to start
$ — Linux console (wasn't tested on Windows, but also should work)
>$ bash start-client.bash [--debug|-d]

[--debug|-d] — optional flag to see all socket input (highlighted with red color).

##Why this piece of crap is in open access
This code was written on the language which I didn't use for about a two years only for the reason of passing exam, so the purpose of publishing it — nothing more than help some students who suddenly realized that in two days they have the exam :)
